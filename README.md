# ngTime

## Idea
Goal was to create a tool to track work on tasks and getting some experience with ng2 + node + websockets in general and chatbots

## Learning objective
  * Create a user friendly frontend with ng2 to track time for tasks
  * NodeJS should provide REST Endpoints to get data out of the database
  * Websocket to provide updates to all connected clients
  * Communication with a chatbot (Skype, Telegram, Slack) for bookings and reports.
  * Get data out of projectmanagement tools (Trello, Slack)
